The aim of this repository is to collect snippets of code that I stumble upon. This is supposed to serve the purpose of being a pointer to the blog article when I go "Oh! I wish I could read the article where the guy found the position of the sequence of '2013' in pi!" rather than a substitute of the article.

Each program comes with a comment in the head (or somewhere in the top, depending on the syntax the languages allow) on where the code was taken from. Note that the blog article and comments under it can be more insightful than just the code. (Putting it shortly, don't use this repo for 'learning' the language)
